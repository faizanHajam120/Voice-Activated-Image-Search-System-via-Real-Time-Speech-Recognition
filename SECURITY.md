## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

Send an email to: **security@yourdomain.com** (replace with your actual email)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 3. What to expect

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep your Google Cloud credentials secure
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Regularly update dependencies
- Run the application in a secure environment
- Monitor access logs

### For Developers
- Never commit credentials or API keys
- Use `.env` files for local development
- Validate all user inputs
- Keep dependencies updated

## Known Security Considerations

### Google Cloud Credentials
- Store service account keys securely
- Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Rotate keys regularly
- Never expose keys in logs or error messages

- Implement proper authentication if exposing APIs
- Consider rate limiting for API endpoints
- Validate all incoming requests
